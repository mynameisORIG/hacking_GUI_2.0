## Enum
This section is for enumerating victim machines.

### Nmap

You will need to have nmap installed in order for this to work

This will run nmap to scan to the victim host you are trying to enumerate. 
Future, we will make the script see which ports would be interesting to enumerate from the nmap scan, and then start enumerating them into each file.

## Shells

This will generate scripts so you can put a reverse shell on the victim machine.

### msfvenom

This uses msfvenom to generate a reverse shell exploit.
